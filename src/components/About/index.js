        Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is James Mahoney, I am a content
        creator who loves old school RPGs, and would love to work on creating on
        as a passion project one day. I am an aspiring software developer,
        always looking to learn new things and hone my skills as I go along.
        Below is a sampling of works I have completed, so you can see the range
        of my development skills. If you have any further questions or would
        like to see a resume, please fill out the information in the "Contact Me" 
        section of this page. I look forward to hearing from you!
